# Dommie
This is a game that simulates the classic domino.
It also implements alternatives in the dynamics of the game.

The project is made up of a class library that contains the game logic and a console application as the first instance of the graphical interface.

To run the project, write the following line of code in the open terminal in the main game folder:

```
dotnet run --project ConsoleApp/ConsoleApp.csproj
```

Then, just enjoy :)
